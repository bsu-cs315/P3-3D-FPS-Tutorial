# Project 3: Intro to 3D with FPS Tutorial 
#### By Curtis Clemmons
## Project Report:
### Reflection:
With this being my first time dealing with 3D game design, coming in to the project I figured I would be lost most of the time but that was not the case. For me at least the tutorial was worded in a way and broken down such that it was easy to follow along with, while still being enjoyable and educational. Overall, I had lots of fun and learned a lot and can't wait to explore godot's 3D engine more on my own.  
### Self-Assessment: 
- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [X] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file that includes the project identifier and author's name.
- [X] C-1: The tutorial has been completed, with at least one commit for each of the two parts.
- [X] B-1: Earn one star.
- [ ] A-1: Earn two stars.
- [X] ⭐ Refactor your solution to follow <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/">our adopted style guide</a>
- [ ] ⭐ Refactor the scripts from Part 2 of the tutorial to enforce the <abbr title="object-oriented">OO</abbr> principle of encapsulation. Explain your refactoring in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [ ] ⭐ Refactor the weapon management code to eliminate some of the redundancy. Explain your refactoring in the <code>README.md</code> file.
